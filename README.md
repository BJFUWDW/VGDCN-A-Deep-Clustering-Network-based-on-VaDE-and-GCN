# VGDCN(Variational Graph convolution Deep Clustering Network)
A Deep Clustering Network based on VaDE and GCN

# Introduction
I improved the clustering accuracy by introducing GCN to VaDE. Dataset:USPS. The code will be updated later.

# Usage

# Reference
This research is my undergraduate graduation project. Thanks for the support of my Alma Mater：Beijing Forestry University.
I may continue to study the deep clustering in Shenyang Institute of Automation Chinese Academy of Sciences in my master's stage, which help me a lot in this project.
My new research will be published here in the name of Robot Vision Group.
